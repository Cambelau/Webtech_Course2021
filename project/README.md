# Chat application - final project

This is our project of web ! Enjoy this webChat

## Usage

*how to start and use the application, run the tests, ...*

* Clone this repository, from your local machine:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/Arlouys/Webtech.git webtech
  cd Webtech/project
  ```

* You can use Docker to run this app:
  ```
  docker-compose up -d
  ```

* Else, install [Go](https://golang.org/) and [Dex](https://dexidp.io/docs/getting-started/). For example, on Ubuntu, from your project root directory:   
  ```
  # Install Go
  apt install golang-go
  # Download Dex
  git clone https://github.com/dexidp/dex.git
  # Build Dex
  cd dex
  make
  make examples
  ```
  Note, the provided `.gitignore` file ignores the `dex` folder.
* Register your GitHub application, get the `clientID` and `clientSecret` from GitHub and report them to your Dex configuration. Modify the provided `./dex-config/config.yml` configuration to look like:
  ```yaml
  - type: github
    id: github
    name: GitHub
    config:
      clientID: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
      clientSecret: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
      redirectURI: http://127.0.0.1:5556/dex/callback
  ```
* Inside `./dex-config/config.yml`, the front-end application is already registered and CORS is activated. Now that Dex is built and configured, you can start the Dex server:
  ```yaml
  cd dex
  bin/dex serve dex-config/config.yaml
  ```
* Start the back-end
  ```bash
  cd back-end
  # Install dependencies (use yarn or npm)
  yarn install
  # Optional, fill the database with initial data
  bin/init
  # Start the back-end
  bin/start
  ```
* Start the front-end
  ```bash
  cd front-end
  # Install dependencies (use yarn or npm)
  yarn install
  # Start the front-end
  yarn start
  ```
